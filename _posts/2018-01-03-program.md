9:15 - 10:30
: *"The Changing Landscape of Refactoring Research in the Last Decade"*
<!-- : *"[Human-centered Methods for Improving API Usability](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/papers/Myers-WAPI-keynote%20submitted.pdf)"* -->
: Workshop Keynote by [Danny Dig (Oregon State University)](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/dig-danny)
: **Abstract:** In the last decade refactoring research has seen exponential growth. I will attempt to map this vast landscape and the advances that the community has made by answering questions such as who does what, when, where, why, and how. I will muse on some of the factors contributing to the growth of the field, the adoption of research into industry, and the lessons that we learned along this journey. This will inspire and equip you so that you can make a difference, with people who make a difference, at a time when it makes a difference.

2:00 - 2:45
: *"Web APIs - Challenges, Design Points, and Research Opportunities"*
: Invited talk by [Erik Wittern (IBM T.J Watson Research Center)](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-witternj)
: **Abstract:** Web APIs provide programmatic, network-based access to remote data or functionalities. Applications, for example, use the Google Places API to learn about nearby establishments, use the Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook API to connect users with friends and family, or use the Stripe API to accept end-user payments. Increasingly, applications themselves consist of micro-services that expose their capabilities to one another using web APIs.
: In comparison to library APIs, which are a common subject of software engineering research, web APIs present unique challenges - both for providers and consumers - that are arguably much less explored yet. In this talk, we outline the characteristics of web APIs causing these challenges. We discuss relevant design points, both for providers and consumers, and how these design points have been implemented by different web API paradigms in recent years. Throughout the talk, we give examples of our research to address web API-related challenges. Our goal is to inspire WAPI attendees to take on some of the many research opportunities surrounding web APIs.
